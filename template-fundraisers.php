                We are thrilled to announce that, on 12th October 2024, the Positive Vibes Foundation celebrated a milestone—our 10th Anniversary Gala Dinner. Thanks to the incredible generosity of our supporters, we raised an astounding $45,000 in donations.

                These contributions will play a vital role in supporting our mission to spread positivity and improve the lives of those in our community.

                The evening was filled with joy, connection, and inspiration as we reflected on the journey of the Positive Vibes Foundation over the past decade. We were honoured to have our dedicated sponsors and volunteers in attendance, whose support has been instrumental in our achievements.

                We extend our heartfelt gratitude to our sponsors, who generously contributed to the success of the gala.

                A special shout-out goes to our amazing volunteers. Your dedication and hard work in organising the event made it a night to remember.

                It was an incredible evening of networking, fundraising, delicious food, music and dance but more importantly it was a night of important conversations about mental health in our community and the role all of us play in helping those around us in their journeys.

                The highlight of the evening was hearing from the inspirational Dr Mark Cross, a well known and respected psychiatrist who shared his own struggles with the black dog from the age of 4 and how he has used his lived experience with anxiety to change the lives of others through his work.

                Mark’s story is raw, it’s real and if you haven’t read his book “Anxiety” we encourage you to do so!

                The Gala Dinner would not have been successful without Mags, Raj and Hannah from Bivianos as well as Jim Taggart, our extraordinary MC for the night as well as support from local Councillors and MPs. We definitely look forward to thanking these incredible individuals as well as sponsors in the fullness of time.

                In the words of Dr Mark Cross “Be brave and be kind”.

                Thank you all for your generosity and kindness to Positive Vibes and the people who access our programs.

            The Positive Vibes Paw Visits program sees volunteers stop by various aged care homes with their furry pals in tow, putting a smile on residentsâ€™ faces.

            The program has seen great success as seniors have loved cuddling, patting and chatting with the doggie friends, working to improve mental health outcomes in these homes.

            We regularly visit various care homes in Glenhaven, Oatlands and North Parramatta and are looking to expand our program to create further positive impact within the community.

            <div class="sutbitlee">
                At the heart of every thriving community lies the well-being of its youth. Recognizing this, the Young Healthy Minds Forum, a transformative event aimed at nurturing the mental health of young individuals, took place on Wednesday 8th May 2024. The overwhelming success of this gathering served as a powerful testament to the importance of addressing mental well-being among the youth. With enthusiastic participation from students, invaluable support from esteemed organizations, and the invaluable guidance of Burn Bright, the event proved to be an inspiring platform for growth and empowerment.

                The Young Healthy Minds Forum brought together 120 students from eight different schools, (Australian International Academy, Castle Hill High, Galston High, Riverstone High, Santa Sophia Catholic College, St John XXIII Catholic College, Hills Grammar, Wollemi College) creating an atmosphere of unity and camaraderie. These bright young minds engaged in a range of insightful discussions and interactive activities designed to promote mental well-being, resilience, and self-empowerment. Through workshops, group exercises, and presentations, participants gained valuable insights into managing stress, building healthy relationships, and developing a positive mindset. </div>
